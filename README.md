## Note
I've been working on this game for about 2 months now, although I started the repo 4 months ago, and its been one of my favorite projects to date!
With a longstanding interest in learning TypeScript and Socket.IO, I figured there's no better approach to learning than by developing a multiplayer game.
This project has proven to be an invaluable learning experience, offering insights not only into acquiring new programming languages but also providing a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies involved in creating multiplayer games.
The multiplayer aspect has emerged as the most challenging component of this project. Navigating decisions on organizing data exchanged between the client and server, determining the relevant data to transmit, and devising strategies to handle diverse scenarios has demanded substantial deliberation and problem-solving.
I look forward to continuing my work on this project and similar endeavors in the future!
